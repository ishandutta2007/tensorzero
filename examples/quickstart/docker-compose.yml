  # The TensorZero Python client *doesn't* require a separate gateway service.
  #
  # The gateway is only needed if you want to use the OpenAI Python client
  # or interact with TensorZero via its HTTP API (for other programming languages).
  #
  # The TensorZero UI also requires the gateway service.
